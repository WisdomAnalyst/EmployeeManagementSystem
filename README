Employee Management System
Overview
A robust Java-based Employee Management System that demonstrates modern Java features including Stream API, Functional Interfaces, and clean code principles. This system provides comprehensive employee data management capabilities with efficient data processing and manipulation.

# Features
Employee data management (CRUD operations)
Advanced data processing using Stream API
Functional programming implementation using Function interface
Salary analytics and reporting
Age-based employee filtering
Comprehensive error handling
Technical Stack
Java 11+
Stream API
Functional Interfaces
Object-Oriented Programming Principles

# Project Structure
com.sms/
├── model/
│   └── Employee.java         - Employee entity class

    └── EmployeeManagementSystem.java  - Main application class

# Key Components
Employee Class
Core entity class representing employee data
Implements encapsulation with private fields and public getters/setters
Properties include: name, age, department, and salary
Overridden toString() method for better object representation
EmployeeService Class
Business logic implementation
Manages employee data operations
Implements functional programming concepts

# Key methods:
addSampleData(): Initializes sample employee records
getEmployeeNameAndDepartment(): Demonstrates Function interface usage
calculateAverageSalary(): Computes average salary using Stream API
filterByAge(): Filters employees based on age criteria
EmployeeManagementSystem Class
Main application entry point
Demonstrates system functionality
Includes comprehensive error handling
Provides formatted output of employee data
Usage Example
EmployeeService employeeService = new EmployeeService();
employeeService.addSampleData();

// Get all employees
List<Employee> allEmployees = employeeService.getAllEmployees();

// Calculate average salary
double avgSalary = employeeService.calculateAverageSalary();

// Filter employees above age 30
List<Employee> seniorEmployees = employeeService.filterByAge(30);
Output Format
The system provides formatted output for:

Complete employee listings
Employee name and department combinations
Average salary calculations
Age-filtered employee lists
Functional interface implementation details
Error Handling
Comprehensive try-catch implementation
Detailed error messaging
Stack trace availability for debugging
Best Practices Implemented
